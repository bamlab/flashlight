phases:
  # The install phase includes commands that install dependencies that your tests use.
  # Default dependencies for testing frameworks supported on Device Farm are already installed.

      # This test execution environment uses Appium version 1.9.1 by default, however we enable you to change it using
      # the Appium version manager (avm). An example "avm" command below changes the version to 1.22.2.
      # For your convenience, we have preinstalled the following versions: 1.22.2, 1.19.0, 1.18.3, 1.18.1, 1.18.0, 1.17.1, 1.16.0, 1.15.1, 1.14.2, 1.14.1, and 1.13.0.
      # To use one of these Appium versions, change the version number in the "avm" command below to your desired version:
      - export APPIUM_VERSION=1.22.2
      - avm $APPIUM_VERSION
