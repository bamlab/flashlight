            An app might run at 60FPS but might be using too much processing
            power, so it's important to check CPU usage.
            <br /> Depending on the device, this value can go up to{" "}
            <code>100% x number of cores</code>. For instance, a Samsung A10s
            has 4 cores, so the max value would be 400%.

        title="Processes with high CPU usage detected"
        explanation={
          <>
            Your app might have low CPU usage overall but if one process is
            saturating a CPU core (using close to 100% CPU), you’re likely to
            experience unresponsiveness, for instance the app not responding to
            touch events.
            <br />
            One example of this is the JS thread being overworked in a React
            Native app, the app will become completely unresponsive even though
            FPS could still be 60.

        explanation={
          <>
            If an app consumes a large amount of RAM (random-access memory), it
            can impact the overall performance of the device and drain the
            battery more quickly.
