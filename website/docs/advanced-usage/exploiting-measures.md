# Exploiting measures

Using JS/TS, you can install the `@perf-profiler/reporter` package to get access to reporting functions for averaging results and more:

```ts
import {
  getAverageCpuUsage,
  getAverageFPSUsage,
  getAverageRAMUsage,
} from "@perf-profiler/reporter";

...

const cpuPerTestIteration = require("./results.json").iterations.map((iteration) =>
  getAverageCpuUsage(iteration.measures)
);
```
