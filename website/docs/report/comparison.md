# Comparing measures

If you have several JSON files of measures, you can open the comparison view with:

```bash
flashlight reports results1.json results2.json results3.json
```

If you pass a folder instead, Flashlight will use all the JSON files in the folder:

```bash
flashlight reports results/
```
