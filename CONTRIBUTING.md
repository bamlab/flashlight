# Contributing

## Commit naming

We use [conventional changelogs](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/#summary) for commits and PR names

It should be like:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

- [ ] with type = feat/fix/refactor/chore/docs/test/‚Ä¶
- [ ] description should be lowercase and start with a verb

Here are some examples https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/#examples

## Running `flashlight` commands locally

Start by building the whole project:

At the root of the repo:

```
yarn
yarn watch
```

Keep this open in one terminal.

### `measure` command

Start the webapp with

```bash
yarn workspace @perf-profiler/measure start
```

Then run the `measure` commmand with:

```bash
DEVELOPMENT_MODE=true node packages/measure/dist/server/bin.js measure
```

### `test` command

To run the command locally:

```

node packages/e2e-performance/dist/bin.js test

```

This command is the equivalent of

```

flashlight test

```

### web-reporter

and run in another terminal:

```

yarn workspace @perf-profiler/web-reporter start

```

Then in `packages/web-reporter/src/App.tsx`, uncomment the lines to add your own measures:

```ts
// Uncomment with when locally testing
// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-var-requires
testCaseResults = [require("../measures.json")];
```

You should now be able to open [the local server](http://localhost:1234/)

Run `yarn jest Plugin -u` after modifications.

### Flipper plugin

- Add the path to the `packages` folder in `~/.flipper/config.json`.

For instance, my `config.json` is currently
`{"pluginPaths":["/Users/almouro/dev/projects/android-performance-profiler/packages"],"disabledPlugins":[],"darkMode":"system","updaterEnabled":true,"launcherEnabled":true,"lastWindowPosition":{"x":-195,"y":-1415,"width":1280,"height":1415}}`

- in the `packages/flipper-plugin-android-performance-profiler`, run `yarn watch`.

You should now see your local plugin in Flipper (ensure you have uninstalled the one from the marketplace), in the disabled plugin section if you're installing for the first time.

‚ö†Ô∏è _when modifying files outside of the `packages/flipper-plugin-android-performance-profiler`, live reload sometimes doesn't work and you need to re-run `yarn watch` for changes to take effect_ üòï
