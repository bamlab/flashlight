# Contributing

Start by building the whole project:

At the root of the repo:

```
yarn
yarn watch
```

Keep this open in one terminal.

### web-reporter

and run in another terminal:

```
yarn workspace @perf-profiler/web-reporter report start
```

Then in `packages/web-reporter/src/App.tsx`, uncomment the lines to add your own measures:

```ts
// Uncomment with when locally testing
// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-var-requires
testCaseResults = [require("../measures.json")];
```

You should now be able to open [the local server](http://localhost:1234/)

Run `yarn jest Plugin -u` after modifications.

### e2e

You can now run `node packages/e2e-performance/dist/bin.js` instead of `npx @perf-profiler/e2e`

### Flipper plugin

- Add the path to the `packages` folder in `~/.flipper/config.json`.

For instance, my `config.json` is currently
`{"pluginPaths":["/Users/almouro/dev/projects/android-performance-profiler/packages"],"disabledPlugins":[],"darkMode":"system","updaterEnabled":true,"launcherEnabled":true,"lastWindowPosition":{"x":-195,"y":-1415,"width":1280,"height":1415}}`

- in the `packages/flipper-plugin-android-performance-profiler`, run `yarn watch`.

You should now see your local plugin in Flipper (ensure you have uninstalled the one from the marketplace), in the disabled plugin section if you're installing for the first time.

‚ö†Ô∏è _when modifying files outside of the `packages/flipper-plugin-android-performance-profiler`, live reload sometimes doesn't work and you need to re-run `yarn watch` for changes to take effect_ üòï
